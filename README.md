# Rock-Paper-Scissors-game-
Problem statement:-
As we all are familiar with the concept of the game. In this game, we have two players. In our program, player 1 will be the user, and player 2 will be the computer. Player 1 selects either rock, paper, or scissor. The computer does not know about what player 1 has selected, so the computer randomly selects any item (rock, paper, or scissor).

In this game, each player has 3 turns. The player who gets the point at least two times will win the game. The following are the rules of the game.

rock vs. scissors -> rock wins

paper vs. scissors -> scissors wins

paper vs. rock -> paper wins
